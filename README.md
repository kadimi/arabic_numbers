Arabic Numbers
==============

Arabic Numbers is a WordPress Plugin. 

When the plugin is enabled, numbers in your website will be converted from Western Arabic (1, 2, 3...) to Eastern Arabic (١, ٢, ٣...), the change will occur in:

- The post title
- The post, page or CPT post content
- The dates

The plugin will not modify your database, it converts numbers on the fly, just before they are displayed to the user in the front-end.
